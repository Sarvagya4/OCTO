# AI-Powered Personal Fitness Trainer for Sedentary lifestyle

- I want to create a distributed multi agent workflow for this that levarges LangGraph, Tools, Memory

## Purpose

- This is a Streamlit app that acts as an AI-powered personal health & fitness trainer.
- It generates personalized diet + workout plans, provides daily coaching chats, and lets users track their progress over time.

## Key components

1. AI Agents (Gemini models)

* Dietary Planner â†’ Creates personalized diet plans.

* Fitness Trainer â†’ Generates workout routines.

* Progress Tracker â†’ Analyzes user progress and check-ins.

* Daily Coach â†’ Conversational chatbot that answers questions and motivates.

* Team Lead â†’ Combines diet + workout into a holistic strategy.

2. LangGraph Workflow

* retrieve_context â†’ Gets userâ€™s latest message + profile.

* generate_response â†’ Calls daily_coach with:

* Context

* User profile

* Last few messages from memory

* Ensures conversations feel adaptive and continuous.

3. Conversation Memory

ConversationMemory class stores chat history in .pkl files.

Saves user â†” coach messages with timestamps.

Keeps last 5â€“10 messages for continuity in conversation.

- persistant memory to store static informations 
1. user_name, user_BMI (ie. wieght hieght age), user_fitness_goals, user_diet preference, user_activity_level, PLAN_CREATED, chat_history

- non-persistant memory to store streaming chat

1. to save the session chat


## Requirements

- on home screen user will enter these variables

### First page 

- name, age, weight, height, fitness goals, activity level, diet preference [Basically user_name, user_BMI, goals]
- UserProfile class stores:

 [Name, age, weight, height, activity level, diet preference, fitness goal.]

- after getting these things in Input a new session_ID will be created for that user 
- have to apply a logic here that If this user_name already exist in the databse, take the existing session_ID (save in the persistant memory) [Decide the persistant memory here]

### second page 

- Now we will create Fitness plan here for the user calling the planner_agent
- If this PLAN_CREATED already in the persistant memory show this plan on the screen 
- else create the plan 
- working of the planner_agent It will use the user_BMI and Gemini_API and DuckDuckGo tool that will take the key information about the health from [WHO API], So after this user will be able to see the Fitness plan for the week attributes [Eating habbits, Exercises] for the week {PLAN_CREATED} save this created plan in the persistant memory

[Meal plans and workout plans.

Profiles are saved/loaded as JSON files (user_data/*.json).]


### third page 

* Daily Coach â†’ Conversational chatbot that answers questions and motivates.

* PROMPTING OF THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT
